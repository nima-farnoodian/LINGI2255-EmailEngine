# LINGI2255-EmailEngine
This is an email engine that reads the emails, extracts the images from the emails, even in the pdf, and finally stores the email contents (images) as HTML file. The address of HTML file is also stored in a table of a DB. This engine was a part of team projet in LINGI2255-Software Engineering Project at UCLouvain for App4you.com. 
Please see my final report to get a gist of how this engine works.
